Developed an intelligent system that monitors driver behavior in real-time to ensure passenger comfort and safety.
 The system dynamically suggests optimal routes by analyzing traffic conditions and adapting to changes. Key
 features include real-time feedback on driving patterns, such as speed and abrupt maneuvers, along with route
 optimization to avoid congestion and improve the overall passenger experience. The system was designed to improve
 driver performance while ensuring a smooth and safe journey for passengers.
